            CRITICAL: You MUST read the CLAUDE.md file FIRST and strictly enforce all guidelines during this review.

            Review this PR against the CLAUDE.md requirements. Flag violations of:
            - Naming conventions (PascalCase components, camelCase hooks/variables, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE constants)
            - Magic numbers (must use named constants)
            - Array index as React key (must use unique identifiers)
            - Memory leaks (intervals/timeouts/subscriptions not cleaned up)
            - Outdated patterns (isMountedRef instead of AbortController)
            - Missing accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
            - Functions over 20-30 lines or with more than 3-4 parameters
            - Unnecessary comments (code should be self-documenting)

            Also review for:
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage for business logic

            Be constructive but firm - violations of CLAUDE.md guidelines should be explicitly called out.
