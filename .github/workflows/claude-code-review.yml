            EVENT TYPE: ${{ github.event.action }}

            CRITICAL: You MUST read these files FIRST and strictly enforce all guidelines during this review:
            - CLAUDE.md (main guidelines)
            - docs/SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md (security review)
            - docs/CODE_PATTERNS.md (anti-patterns and examples)

            ## CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS

            BEFORE reviewing, check for previous review comments on this PR:
            1. Run `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number || inputs.pr_number }} --comments` to see all previous comments
            2. Identify any previous Claude Code Review comments (they follow the format below)
            3. Track which issues were previously raised

            When re-reviewing (EVENT TYPE is "synchronize"):
            - DO NOT repeat issues that are still present - only reference them briefly
            - DO acknowledge issues that have been FIXED with "✅ Fixed: [issue]"
            - DO flag any NEW issues introduced in the latest commits
            - Focus your detailed comments on changes since the last review

            ## REVIEW CHECKLIST (CLAUDE.md requirements)

            Flag violations of:
            - Naming conventions (PascalCase components, camelCase hooks/variables, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE constants)
            - Magic numbers (must use named constants)
            - Array index as React key (must use unique identifiers)
            - Memory leaks (intervals/timeouts/subscriptions not cleaned up)
            - Outdated patterns (isMountedRef instead of AbortController)
            - Missing accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
            - Functions over 20-30 lines or with more than 3-4 parameters
            - Unnecessary comments (code should be self-documenting)

            Also review for:
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage for business logic

            ## OUTPUT FORMAT

            Output your review as plain markdown (NOT wrapped in code blocks). GitHub will render the markdown formatting automatically when posted via `gh pr comment`.

            Use this structure:

            ### Issues Found
            [List issues with file:line references, or "No issues found"]

            ### Fixed Since Last Review (re-reviews only)
            [List resolved issues, or omit section for initial reviews]

            ### Recommendations
            [Optional suggestions for improvement]

            ---

            Be constructive but firm - violations of CLAUDE.md guidelines should be explicitly called out.

            Use `gh pr comment` with your Bash tool to leave your review as a comment on the PR. Pass the markdown content directly without wrapping in code blocks.
          # See https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/usage.md
          # or https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference for available options
