            CRITICAL: You MUST read these files FIRST and strictly enforce all guidelines during this review:
            - CLAUDE.md (main guidelines)
            - docs/SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md (security review)
            - docs/CODE_PATTERNS.md (anti-patterns and examples)

            ## CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS

            BEFORE reviewing, check for previous review comments on this PR:
            1. Run `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comments` to see all previous comments
            2. Identify any previous Claude Code Review comments (they follow the format below)
            3. Track which issues were previously raised

            When re-reviewing (EVENT TYPE is "synchronize"):
            - DO NOT repeat issues that are still present - only reference them briefly
            - DO acknowledge issues that have been FIXED with "✅ Fixed: [issue]"
            - DO flag any NEW issues introduced in the latest commits
            - Focus your detailed comments on changes since the last review

            ## REVIEW CHECKLIST (CLAUDE.md requirements)

            Flag violations of:
            - Naming conventions (PascalCase components, camelCase hooks/variables, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE constants)
            - Magic numbers (must use named constants)
            - Array index as React key (must use unique identifiers)
            - Memory leaks (intervals/timeouts/subscriptions not cleaned up)
            - Outdated patterns (isMountedRef instead of AbortController)
            - Missing accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
            - Functions over 20-30 lines or with more than 3-4 parameters
            - Unnecessary comments (code should be self-documenting)

            Also review for:
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage for business logic

            ## OUTPUT FORMAT

            IMPORTANT: Output your review as a raw markdown code block (wrapped in triple backticks) that can be copy-pasted directly into GitHub. Do NOT output already-rendered/formatted text.

            Use this exact structure:

            ```
