  <h1>Getting Started with VolleyKit</h1>

  <p class="lead text-text-secondary dark:text-text-secondary-dark">
    VolleyKit is a progressive web application that provides an improved interface for managing
    your volleyball referee assignments through the Swiss Volleyball Federation's volleymanager system.
  </p>

  <h2>What is VolleyKit?</h2>

  <p>
    VolleyKit connects to the official volleymanager.volleyball.ch platform and provides a modern,
    mobile-friendly interface for referees to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>View upcoming game assignments</li>
    <li>Request and manage game exchanges with other referees</li>
    <li>Track compensation payments</li>
    <li>Access assignments offline</li>
    <li>Calculate travel times using Swiss public transport</li>
  </ul>

  <InfoBox type="info">
    <p>
      VolleyKit is an unofficial app created to improve the referee experience. All data comes
      from the official volleymanager system.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h2>How to Login</h2>

  <p>
    VolleyKit offers two ways to access your assignments:
  </p>

  <h3>Option 1: Calendar Mode (Recommended)</h3>

  <p>
    For quick access to view your schedule without entering your password, you can use
    Calendar Mode with your unique calendar URL or code from volleymanager.
  </p>

  <StepList
    steps={[
      {
        title: 'Find your calendar URL',
        description: 'In volleymanager, go to "My Assignments" and copy your calendar subscription URL.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Select Calendar Mode',
        description: 'On the VolleyKit login page, tap the "Calendar Mode" tab.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Paste your URL or code',
        description: 'Enter your calendar URL or just the code portion to access your schedule.',
      },
    ]}
  />

  <InfoBox type="info">
    <p>
      Calendar Mode provides read-only access – you can view assignments but cannot
      confirm games, request exchanges, or access compensations. See the
      <a href={`${BASE_PATH}/calendar-mode/`}>Calendar Mode guide</a> for more details.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h3>Option 2: Full Login</h3>

  <p>
    Use your volleymanager.volleyball.ch credentials for full access to all features.
  </p>

  <StepList
    steps={[
      {
        title: 'Open VolleyKit',
        description: 'Navigate to the VolleyKit app in your browser or open the installed app.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Enter your credentials',
        description: 'Use your volleymanager username and password to log in.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Stay logged in',
        description: 'Enable "Remember me" to stay logged in between sessions.',
      },
    ]}
  />

  <DeviceScreenshot
    id="login-page"
    alt="VolleyKit login page showing username and password fields"
    caption="The VolleyKit login page"
    instructions="Take a screenshot of the login page with empty form fields. Show the VolleyKit branding, username/password inputs, and login button."
  />

  <InfoBox type="tip" title="Can't remember your password?">
    <p>
      VolleyKit uses the same credentials as volleymanager.volleyball.ch. Use the password
      reset function on the official site if you've forgotten your password.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h2>Quick Tour</h2>

  <p>
    After logging in, you'll see the main dashboard with your upcoming assignments.
    Here's a quick overview of the main sections:
  </p>

  <h3>Assignments</h3>
  <p>
    View all your upcoming referee games. Each assignment shows the date, time, teams,
    venue, and your role (1st referee, 2nd referee, or line judge).
  </p>

  <h3>Exchanges</h3>
  <p>
    Browse available game exchanges from other referees or request an exchange for
    one of your own assignments.
  </p>

  <h3>Compensations</h3>
  <p>
    Track your referee payments and compensation history. Filter by date range
    and export your data.
  </p>

  <h3>Settings</h3>
  <p>
    Customize your experience including language, home location for travel calculations,
    and notification preferences.
  </p>
