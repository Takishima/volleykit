  <h1>Getting Started with VolleyKit</h1>

  <p class="lead text-text-secondary dark:text-text-secondary-dark">
    VolleyKit is a progressive web application that provides an improved interface for managing
    your volleyball referee assignments through the Swiss Volleyball Federation's volleymanager system.
  </p>

  <h2>What is VolleyKit?</h2>

  <p>
    VolleyKit connects to the official volleymanager.volleyball.ch platform and provides a modern,
    mobile-friendly interface for referees to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>View upcoming game assignments</li>
    <li>Request and manage game exchanges with other referees</li>
    <li>Track compensation payments</li>
    <li>Access assignments offline</li>
    <li>Calculate travel times using Swiss public transport</li>
  </ul>

  <InfoBox type="info">
    <p>
      VolleyKit is an unofficial app created to improve the referee experience. All data comes
      from the official volleymanager system.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h2>How to Login</h2>

  <p>
    To use VolleyKit, you need valid credentials for the volleymanager.volleyball.ch system.
    These are the same credentials you use to access the official website.
  </p>
