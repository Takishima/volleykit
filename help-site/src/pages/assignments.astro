    referee games and managing your schedule.

  </ul>

  <h2>Viewing Your Assignments</h2>

  <h2>Taking Actions</h2>

  <p>
    VolleyKit uses swipe gestures to quickly access actions on your assignment cards.
    Depending on the game status, you may have different actions available.
  </p>

  <h3>Swipe Right – Add to Exchange</h3>

  <p>
    Swipe an assignment card to the <strong>right</strong> to reveal the exchange action.
    If you can't attend a game, you can add it to the exchange board for other
    referees to pick up.
  </p>

  />

  <InfoBox type="warning">
    <p>
      Make sure to request an exchange well in advance. Last-minute requests
      may not find a replacement in time.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h3>Swipe Left – Validate &amp; Edit</h3>

  <p>
    Swipe an assignment card to the <strong>left</strong> to reveal additional actions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Validate</strong> – Submit game results and validate the match (available for first referees after the game)</li>
    <li><strong>Edit</strong> – Edit your compensation details for this assignment</li>

  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Upcoming</strong> – Games that haven't happened yet</li>
    <li><strong>Validation Closed</strong> – Past games where validation is complete</li>
