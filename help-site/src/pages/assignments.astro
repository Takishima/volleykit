  <h1>Managing Your Assignments</h1>

  <p class="lead text-text-secondary dark:text-text-secondary-dark">
    The Assignments section is your central hub for viewing all your upcoming volleyball
    referee games and managing your schedule.
  </p>

  <h2>What Are Assignments?</h2>

  <p>
    Assignments are the games you've been scheduled to referee. Each assignment includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Date and time</strong> – When the game takes place</li>
    <li><strong>Teams</strong> – Home and away team names</li>
    <li><strong>Venue</strong> – Location of the game with address</li>
    <li><strong>Your role</strong> – 1st referee, 2nd referee, or line judge</li>
    <li><strong>League</strong> – The competition level (e.g., NLA, NLB, 1. Liga)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Viewing Your Assignments</h2>

  <p>
    The assignment list shows all your upcoming games in chronological order.
    Games are grouped by date, making it easy to see what's coming up.

  <h3>List vs. Card View</h3>

  <p>
    Toggle between list view (compact) and card view (detailed) using the view
    switcher in the top right. Card view shows more information at a glance,
    while list view lets you see more games on screen.
  </p>

  <h2>Taking Actions</h2>

  <p>
    Depending on the game status, you may have different actions available:
  </p>

  <h3>Confirm Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    Confirm that you'll be attending the game. This updates your status in
    the volleymanager system.
  </p>

  <h3>Request Exchange</h3>
  <p>
    If you can't attend a game, you can request an exchange. This posts your
    assignment to the exchange board for other referees to pick up.
  </p>

  <InfoBox type="warning">
    <p>
      Make sure to request an exchange well in advance. Last-minute requests
      may not find a replacement in time.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h3>Get Directions</h3>
  <p>
    Opens your preferred maps application with directions to the venue.
  </p>

  <h2>Filtering and Sorting</h2>

  <p>
    Use the filter options to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Show only unconfirmed games</li>
    <li>Filter by role (1st referee, 2nd referee, line judge)</li>
    <li>Filter by league</li>
    <li>Change the date range</li>
  </ul>
