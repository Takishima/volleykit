    referee games and managing your schedule.

  <h2>What Are Assignments?</h2>

    <li><strong>Venue</strong> – Location of the game with address</li>
    <li><strong>Your role</strong> – 1st referee, 2nd referee, or line judge</li>
    <li><strong>League</strong> – The competition level (e.g., NLA, NLB, 1. Liga)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Viewing Your Assignments</h2>

  <h2>Taking Actions</h2>

  <p>
    Depending on the game status, you may have different actions available:
  </p>

  <h3>Request Exchange</h3>
  <p>
    If you can't attend a game, you can request an exchange. This posts your
    assignment to the exchange board for other referees to pick up.
  </p>

  <InfoBox type="warning">
    <p>
      Make sure to request an exchange well in advance. Last-minute requests
      may not find a replacement in time.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h3>Get Directions</h3>
  <p>
    Opens your preferred maps application with directions to the venue.
  </p>
