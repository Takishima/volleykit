  <h1>Tracking Your Compensations</h1>

  <p class="lead text-text-secondary dark:text-text-secondary-dark">
    The Compensations section helps you track your referee earnings and payment
    history. View past payments, filter by date range, and export your data
    for record-keeping.
  </p>

  <h2>What Are Compensations?</h2>

  <p>
    Compensations are the payments you receive for officiating volleyball games.
    Each compensation entry typically includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Game details</strong> – The match you officiated</li>
    <li><strong>Date</strong> – When the game took place</li>
    <li><strong>Amount</strong> – The compensation amount in CHF</li>
    <li><strong>Payment status</strong> – Pending, paid, or processed</li>
    <li><strong>Role</strong> – Your function in the game</li>
  </ul>

  <InfoBox type="info">
    <p>
      Compensation amounts are set by Swiss Volley and vary based on the league
      level and your role in the game.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h2>Viewing Your Compensations</h2>

  <p>
    The compensation list shows all your recorded payments in chronological order.
    Each entry displays the key information at a glance.

  <h3>Understanding Payment Status</h3>

  <p>
    Compensations can have different statuses:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pending</strong> – Game completed, payment not yet processed</li>
    <li><strong>Processing</strong> – Payment is being processed</li>
    <li><strong>Paid</strong> – Payment has been made to your account</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Filtering by Status</h2>

  <p>
    Use the tabs at the top to filter compensations by their status:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pending (Past)</strong> – Past games awaiting payment</li>
    <li><strong>Pending (Future)</strong> – Upcoming games not yet played</li>
    <li><strong>Closed</strong> – Completed and paid compensations</li>
  </ul>

    <p>
      Compensations are automatically filtered to the current season (September
      to May) so you can focus on recent games.

  <h2>Export to PDF</h2>

  <p>
    You can export individual compensation records as PDF documents. Swipe left
    on any compensation card to reveal the PDF export action.
  </p>

  <p>
    The exported PDF includes the game details and compensation information
    in a formatted document. This is useful for providing to teams that need
    to pay the referee directly.
  </p>

  <InfoBox type="info">
    <p>
      The PDF export creates an official-looking document with all the game
      and compensation details that teams may require for their records.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h2>Payment Schedule</h2>

  <p>
    Compensation payments are typically processed monthly by Swiss Volley.
    The exact payment schedule may vary, but generally:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Games from the previous month are processed at the start of each month</li>
    <li>Payments are made via bank transfer to your registered account</li>
    <li>Processing may take 2-4 weeks after the month ends</li>
  </ul>

  <InfoBox type="warning">
    <p>
      Make sure your bank details are up to date in the volleymanager system
      to avoid payment delays.
