    <li><strong>Date</strong> – When the game took place</li>
    <li><strong>Amount</strong> – The compensation amount in CHF</li>
    <li><strong>Payment status</strong> – Pending, paid, or processed</li>
    <li><strong>Role</strong> – Your function in the game</li>
  </ul>

    <p>
      Compensation amounts are set by Swiss Volley and vary based on the league
      level and your role in the game.

  <h3>Understanding Payment Status</h3>

    <li><strong>Paid</strong> – Payment has been made to your account</li>

    Use the date filter to view compensations for a specific time period:
  </p>

    <li><strong>This month</strong> – Current month's compensations</li>
    <li><strong>Last month</strong> – Previous month's compensations</li>
    <li><strong>This season</strong> – Current volleyball season</li>
    <li><strong>Custom range</strong> – Select specific start and end dates</li>
  </ul>
