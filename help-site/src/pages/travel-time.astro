  <h1>Travel Time Feature</h1>

  <p class="lead text-text-secondary dark:text-text-secondary-dark">
    VolleyKit integrates with Swiss public transport data to show you how long
    it takes to reach each game venue. Plan your trips better and never be late
    to a game.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>

  <p>
    The travel time feature uses the Swiss public transport API (SBB/öV) to
    calculate journey times from your home location to each game venue. It
    considers:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Real-time train, bus, and tram schedules</li>
    <li>Walking time to/from stations</li>
    <li>Transfer times between connections</li>
    <li>The actual game start time</li>
  </ul>

  <InfoBox type="info">
    <p>
      Travel times are calculated using public transport. If you typically
      drive, use the times as a rough estimate or for planning alternative
      transport options.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h2>Setting Your Home Location</h2>

  <p>
    To get accurate travel times, you need to set your home location in the
    app settings.
  </p>

    steps={[
      {
        title: 'Open Settings',
        description: 'Navigate to the Settings page in VolleyKit.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Find "Home Location"',
        description: 'Scroll to the travel settings section.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Enter your address',
        description: 'Type your home address or the station you typically travel from.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Save your settings',
        description: 'Confirm your location to start seeing travel times.',
      },
    ]}
  />

    alt="Settings page showing home location input field"
    caption="Setting your home location"
    instructions="Take a screenshot of the settings page focused on the home location section. Show the address input field with autocomplete suggestions if possible."
  />

  <InfoBox type="tip">
    <p>
      Use your nearest train station as your home location if you typically
      walk or cycle to the station – this gives more accurate public transport times.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h2>Viewing Travel Times</h2>

  <p>
    Once your home location is set, travel times appear on your assignment cards
    and in the assignment detail view.
  </p>

  />

  <h3>What's Shown</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Duration</strong> – Total travel time from home to venue</li>
    <li><strong>Departure time</strong> – When you should leave to arrive on time</li>
    <li><strong>Transport type</strong> – Train, bus, or mixed transport icon</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Connection details (train numbers, platforms)</li>
    <li>Walking segments</li>
    <li>Transfer times</li>

    instructions="Take a screenshot showing the expanded journey details or a modal with the full route. Include departure/arrival times, train/bus details, and any transfer information."
  />

  <h2>Arrival Buffer</h2>

  <p>
    The suggested departure time includes a buffer to ensure you arrive before
    the game starts:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Standard buffer:</strong> 15-30 minutes before game time</li>
    <li>Time for finding the venue, changing, and warmup</li>
    <li>Account for potential minor delays</li>
  </ul>

  <InfoBox type="warning">
    <p>
      Always allow extra time for important games or unfamiliar venues.
      Public transport can experience unexpected delays.
    </p>
  </InfoBox>

  <h2>Offline Availability</h2>

  <p>
    Travel times are cached when you view them online. If you're offline:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Previously viewed travel times remain available</li>
    <li>New calculations require an internet connection</li>
